You are lookging at my private website. 
Its primary purpose is to serve as a dumping ground for random thoughts that are probably not of use to anyone.

I am Stefan, currently employed as a visiting professor at the [University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt's](https://h-da.de/) [Computer Science Department](https://www.fbi.h-da.de/~s.ruehl/). This occupation allows me to pass on my deep passion for software engineering, IT technology, and computer science in general.
