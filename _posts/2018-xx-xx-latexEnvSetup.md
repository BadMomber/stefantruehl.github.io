# <a name="SetupFromScratch"></a>How to setup a LaTeX Environment from Scretch?
If you have no LaTeX environment running and want still fill in this template using LaTeX, you may try the following combination of tools - Setup Visual Studio Code as IDE, LaTeX Workshop as extension for VS Code to edit LaTeX, and Tex Live as LaTeX distribution. 

Please understand, if you have a running environment that makes sense for you - stick with it. It is by no means necessary to use the one poposed here. 
Further, there are probably better environments out there. 
However, I personally find this setup highly usable.
This is due to the points that, it is available for all major operating systems, it is light weight, and easy to use. 

If you want to give it a shoot, here is how to set it up:

#### Step 1: Install TeX Live
The [project's website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/ "TeX Live Website") descibes [TeX Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live "Wikipedia on TeX Live") as: "an easy way to get up and running with the TeX document production system. It provides a comprehensive TeX system with binaries for most flavors of Unix, including GNU/Linux, and also Windows. It includes all the major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts that are free software, including support for many languages around the world."

It is available for all major operating systems. 
You will find how tos for installing it on your machine on the [project's website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/ "TeX Live Website").

I would recommend to go for a full installation, as this may prevent any trouble of missing packages later. 
As an example, as a Fedora user I simply installed the _texlive-scheme-full_ package though _dnf_ (installing all LaTeX packages that TeX Live has to offer)

#### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
