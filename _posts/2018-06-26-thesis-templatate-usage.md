At our [CS department](https://www.fbi.h-da.de/fbi.html) at [University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt](https://h-da.de/) we recommend a specific LaTeX template to your students, for the creation of Bachelor's and Master's theses. This template can be found [here](https://github.com/mbredel/thesis-template).

In this article I want do describe how to work with the thesis template in the Latex environnement that I proposed in my previous [article](https://stefantruehl.github.io/2018/04/30/latexEnvSetup.html).


## Introduction 
In a previous post I have described how to setup a LaTeX environment based on the following tool stack: 
- **TeX Live** ([link](https://www.tug.org/texlive/ ) - version installed on my machine: TeX Live 2016) - very popular LaTeX distribution that brings along a huge number of packages.
- **Visual Studio Code** (aka VS Code - [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - version installed on my machine: 1.22.2) - rather lightweight but very powerful IDE that brings great extendability for a vast variate of different languages. 
- **LaTeX Workshop** ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) - version installed on my machine: 5.3.1) - extension for Visual Studio Code that aims to provide all-in-one features and utilities for LaTeX typesetting (list of features can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)).

For reasons why I consider this stack to be very useful and a description on how to set it up, please refer to the [article](https://stefantruehl.github.io/2018/04/30/latexEnvSetup.html). 
For the remainder of this article, I assume you have a working setup of the tool chain, according to the [article](https://stefantruehl.github.io/2018/04/30/latexEnvSetup.html).


## Step 1: Clone Thesis Template



## Step 2: Configure VS Code


## Step 3: Write your Thesis and have fun
